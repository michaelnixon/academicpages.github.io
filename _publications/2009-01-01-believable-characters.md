excerpt: 'The interactive entertainment industry is one of the fastest growing industries in the world. In 1996, the U.S. entertainment
software industry reported $2.6 billion in sales revenue, this figure has more than tripled in 2007 yielding $9.5 billion
in revenues [1]. In addition, gamers, the target market for interactive entertainment products, are now reaching beyond the
traditional 8–34 year old male to include women, Hispanics, and African Americans [2]. This trend has been observed in several
markets, including Japan, China, Korea, and India, who has just published their first international AAA title (defined as
high quality games with high budget), a 3D third person action game: Ghajini – The Game [3]. The topic of believable characters is becoming a central issue when designing and developing games for today’s game
industry. While narrative and character were considered secondary to game mechanics, games are currently evolving to integrate
characters, narrative, and drama as part of their design. One can see this pattern through the emergence of games like Assassin’s Creed (published by Ubisoft 2008), Hotel Dusk (published by Nintendo 2007), and Prince of Persia series (published by Ubisoft), which emphasized character and narrative as part of their design.'
