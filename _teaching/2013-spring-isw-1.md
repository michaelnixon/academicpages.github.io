The ISW is an intensive, 3-day peer-based instructional development. Through participation in this workshop, I was able to learn about a wider variety of approaches to active learning, which I have incorporated into my teaching. Active learning approaches have helped immensely for planning labs and workshops, but have also been useful for making lectures more engaging and meaningful.
