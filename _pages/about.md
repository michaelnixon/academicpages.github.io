Michael Nixon is a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Interactive Arts & Technology (Simon Fraser University). He researches how to make virtual characters more believable in interactive narrative and social contexts through the use of better cognitive models and procedurally-animated non-verbal behaviour. He is also interested in how new kinds of natural user interfaces can enable novel game mechanics. Michael defended his M.Sc. in 2009, which investigated the use of Delsarte's movement principles for animating believable characters. He also has a BSc (Computer Science) and a Diploma in Digital Media Technology from Vancouver Island University.

Research interests:
- Believable agents, particularly cognitive model-based approaches for control of nonverbal behaviour (e.g. social eye gaze).
- Procedural animation character systems
- Novel UI modalities, especially for controlling an avatar
- Games studies
